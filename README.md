# Replit-Teams-For-EDU-Downloader
A drop-in replacement for something that Replit was supposed to make a month ago.

# Quickstart
Copy the code in `main.js`, navigate to your EDU team (e.g. https://replit.com/team/your-team-name), and then paste it into the developer console (Inspect Element). Your browser should then start to prompt you to download your repls.
